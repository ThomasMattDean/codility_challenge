## Peaks Challenge from Codility

Repository showcasing work by Thomas Dean. I included this to demonstrate experience with python3, unittesting and problem solving.

This script contains the correct solution for the Codility problem 10.3 'Peaks'.

### Set up

The script can be run with python3. 

The script only uses 'math' and 'unittest' so no packages need to be installed.

### Written with

Python 3.6.5
